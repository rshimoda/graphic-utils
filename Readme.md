## This is a starting point to play with Swift multiplatform development.

Fell free to play and try building it for your own.
                                            
### Possible challenges:
* [ ] Add WASM compatibility to ColorUtils
* [ ] Add Node.js native module adapter using N-API
* [ ] Add Flutter support via @objc adapter using Platform Channels
* [ ] Add Metal supprt for color porcessing, use it for iOS and macOS (and elsewhere where Metal is available)
* [ ] Add ImageUtils for basic operations with images (using the same principles as ColorUtils)
* [ ] Add CI for multiplatform builds
* [ ] You name it!
